The Heat Map displays data about cyclists' performance over time.
Each point on the scatter plot represents a cyclist's performance in a specific year. 
The x-axis represents the year, and the y-axis represents the time taken by the cyclist to complete the race.
The color of each point indicates whether the cyclist was involved in doping allegations.

It is built using D3.js library
